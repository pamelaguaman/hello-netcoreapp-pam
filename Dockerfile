# Dockerfile for creating a Docker image that contains the .NET Core app's FDD
# It makes use of multi-stage builds and requires Docker 17.05 or later:
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/multistage-build/

# Builder image
# Don't bother to clean up the image - it's only used for building

# Use philippgille/dotnet-libglib as long as the AppImage gets created in build.sh.
# In the final Docker image the AppImage isn't needed, so "FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.0-sdk" would suffice.
